# Informal Response 

For this module, I continued to use Cambodia. The first step was to download all of the data from both sites. The GAMD database was not working the first few tries I tried to download the data, but after a couple days of checking every few hours the data finally downloaded sucessfully and completely. There were no other problems getting data from Worldpop, and I was able to get a population raster for both 2019 and 2020, but I ended up using the raster from 2019 in the end. From the data in class, here are some figures I was able to create. 

#### Map of Cambodia 
This includes layers the first two administrative levels inside Cambodia. Only the first administration has levels though for optimal readability.
